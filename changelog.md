Changelog 6/17
Imperium Combat Update (BETA)

New bosses and combat mechanics are now available
The following bosses are available:
Hasty Goblin (miniboss)
Strengthened Ravager (miniboss)
Terminator
Evolved Inferno
Vorpal Spirit Master
Elemental Water Fairy (advanced)
For now, spawning a boss requires you to complete a boss quest (they are in the bottom 2 tiles in /quests). You'll receive a spawn egg which allows you to spawn the boss anytime. More boss information also exists at the bottom of the GUI in /quests.
Some bosses are harder than others, and may not be beginner friendly. Don't expect all the bosses to be a cakewalk.
There are also new custom items that can be obtained from killing these bosses. Most notably, the Hasty Goblin Pickaxe, Bloodied Axe, and Sylvetta Longbow. These items have custom mechanics that allow for much greater damage distribution if used correctly. More detailed information on these items will be available soon.

Remember that this system is still in beta and may suddenly change
Some other changes:
- Totems, ender pearls, signs, and minecarts are now stackable (8, 32, 32, 16 respectively)
- Fixed a bug where some pets would itemstack on themselves
- Fixed an issue with quests that would prevent rewards
- AFK status is now shown as a suffix on tab
- Obsidian Trident chance in obsidian crate was reduced

Known Bugs:
- Some bosses may randomly disappear
- Boss egg is lost if inv is full
- Some players lose access to /god after killing a boss (usually happens when player abandons boss instead of killing)
- Quest resetting still not working
- Vorpal Spirit Master boss drains durability at an unreasonable rate
- Hasty Goblin fireball not working correctly
- Dragon pet is not working
