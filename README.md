Some configuration files for Imperium.

This repository does not actually contain any real program or application. It's simply a host for Imperium configuration files that all developers can use. We will be using select files and adding commits to them as necessary.
If you are writing a plugin, program, or some API that Imperium could use, you're free to copy it here.

Non-collaborators (anyone who isn't a dev) can fork this repository and make a pull request to suggest changes.
