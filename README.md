Some configuration files for Imperium.

This repository does not actually contain any real program or application. It's simply a host for Imperium configuration files that all developers can use. We will be using select files and adding commits to them as necessary.
If you are writing a plugin, program, or some API that Imperium could use, you're free to copy it here.
Do not share this repository with anyone outside of the Imperium Staff Team.
