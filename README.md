# Imperium GitHub Dev Portal
Some configuration files for Imperium.

This repository contains some files used by Imperium Network. Mostly YAMLs that integrate with other plugins, but there is some Java, some Kotlin, and even a little batchfile/Shell. Imperium developers can commit to this repository anytime. Try to keep the repo updated with the host files.
A lot of files are deprecated and have no function. Hopefully I can reorganize this repo into something easier to follow. Some .java files within certain directores also have their own repository (mostly built with Maven).

Non-collaborators (anyone who isn't a dev) can fork this repository and make a pull request to suggest changes.
